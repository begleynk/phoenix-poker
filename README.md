# Poker

A multiplayer Texas Hold'em Poker game built with Phoenix LiveView.

Years ago I attempted to build a [poker game in Phoenix](https://github.com/begleynk/elixir-poker-server/),
but like many side projects it fell by the wayside. This is a re-imagining of that project, but
with LiveView.

## Status

Still a work in progress.

## TODO

* [ ] Proof of concept game UI
  * [ ] PubSub broadcast of game state changes
  * [ ] Hook up Phoenix presence to detect user disconnects
